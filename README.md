# AncalagonTeamProject
This is a team project based on a web blog.
The goal is to create automation tests to fully test the blog's UI.

Project Description

You will be given a little web project, which you will have to test. The project is a basic blog with very little functionality, but don’t worry, this is just version 0.1, and we have a lot to do before the application goes in production. Upon seeing the project, you should create the idea of how a real blog looks, and you should prepare Software Requirements Specification (SRS). Then you will have to prepare a test plan – how the test process will go and what test techniques will be used. You can prepare test scenarios with test cases in them. The real job comes here – you need to build a test framework with Selenium WebDriver, which you will have to merge with the blog in Continuous Integration project via TeamCity. You need to fully automate the UI testing process, because at the end of the course you will be given version 0.2 of the blog. Upon committing changes in the blog, the test project has to automatically test the old functionalities, find bugs and report them, if there are any.
